# MFA-Forced-Alignment
Forced speech alignment analysis using Praat with phoneme-level validation and timing metrics.

# Forced Alignment Assignment - MFA + Praat

## Objective
Perform speech forced alignment using Montreal Forced Aligner and analyze segmentation accuracy using Praat.


## Dataset
Contains WAV recordings and transcript LAB files used for alignment.

Structure:
- wav/ → audio recordings
- transcripts/ → text transcripts
- output/ → generated TextGrid files and alignment metrics
- screenshots/ → visualization of alignment results


## Alignment Output
Generated Praat TextGrid files showing word and phoneme segmentation.


## Screenshots
Visual proof of alignment:

- administration word segmentation
- sentence-level alignment example
- phoneme-level segmentation


## Tools Used
- Montreal Forced Aligner
- Praat

Metrics computed:
- log likelihood
- speech log likelihood
- phoneme duration deviation
- SNR


## Results
Alignment quality metrics are provided in CSV format.


## Files
- TextGrid outputs for each recording
- CSV summary of alignment metrics


## Conclusion
Forced alignment successfully segmented speech into word and phoneme units, validated visually using Praat.
