In nineteen seventy- six, Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis

fulfilled a campaign promise  to de-politicize judicial appointments.

He named Republican  Edward Hennessy   to head the State Supreme

Judicial Court.    For Hennessy, it was another step along a

distinguished career that began as a trial lawyer

and led to an appointment  as  associate Supreme Court

Justice  in 1971. That year Thomas Maffy,

now president of the Massachusetts Bar Association, was Hennessy's

law clerk.
