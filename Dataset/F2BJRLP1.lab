Wanted:  Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court.  In April,

the S.J.C.'s current leader Edward Hennessy reaches the mandatory

retirement age of seventy,  and  a  successor is expected to be

named in March. It may be the most important appointment

Governor Michael Dukakis makes during the remainder of

his administration and one of the toughest.  As WBUR's

Margo Melnicove reports, Hennessy will be a hard act to follow.
